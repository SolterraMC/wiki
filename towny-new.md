# Towny Plugin Documentation

![Towny Town](/towny-solterra.jpg)

[Towny](https://townyadvanced.github.io/) is a land management plugin that lets players create and manage towns. Players can claim chunks of land (16x16 blocks) as protected town territory.

## Getting Started

**New players start as Nomads.** You can either:
- Join an existing town (if invited or open)
- Create your own town for **$1,000** with `/town new [name]`

**GUI Alternative:** Use `/tmenu` for an interactive menu interface

**Quick Reference:** 
- View available plots: `/town catalog`
- Check town list: `/town list`
- See who's online: `/town online`
