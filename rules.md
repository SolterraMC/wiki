# Rules

## [1] Kindness First
**Be friendly, respectful, and welcoming to all players.**

This is our golden rule. Every player deserves to feel welcome and valued in our community. This means:
- Greet new players and offer help when they're learning
- Use respectful language even during disagreements
- Give others the benefit of the doubt - assume positive intent
- Be patient with players who may be younger or less experienced
- Celebrate others' achievements and builds
- If someone makes a mistake, help them learn rather than criticize
- Remember there's a real person behind every character

## [2] No Griefing or Stealing
**Don't harm others' builds, belongings, or progress.**

Respect is shown through actions. Even in wilderness areas:
- Never break or modify another player's builds without explicit permission
- Don't take items from unlocked chests that aren't yours
- Don't kill other players' animals or destroy their farms
- Don't claim land right next to someone's town to block expansion
- Don't intentionally ruin the landscape around others' builds
- If you accidentally damage something, fix it or notify the owner
- "It wasn't protected" is not an excuse - respect others' work regardless

## [3] Cozy Chat Only
**Keep chat positive and safeâ€”no spam, hate, or toxicity.**

Our chat should be a comfortable space for everyone:
- No hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Keep profanity to an absolute minimum
- Don't spam messages, letters, or symbols
- Avoid controversial topics that create division (politics, etc.)
- Don't share inappropriate content or links
- Keep criticism constructive and kind
- Don't advertise other servers or products
- Use English in global chat so moderators can help maintain safety

## [4] Fair Play
**No cheats, exploits, or hacks of any kind.**

Everyone should have the same opportunities to enjoy the game:
- No hacked clients, x-ray texture packs, or unauthorized mods
- Don't exploit bugs or glitches - report them instead
- No auto-clickers, macros, or automation tools
- Don't use alt accounts to circumvent limitations
- No duplication glitches or economy manipulation
- Play the game as intended - shortcuts ruin the experience for everyone
- If you're unsure if something is allowed, ask staff first

## [5] Community Spirit
**Build and play in a way that adds to the cozy vibe.**

Help create the warm, welcoming atmosphere we all enjoy:
- Build with aesthetics in mind - even farms can be pretty!
- Help with community projects and events when you can
- Share resources with newer players when possible
- Keep the areas around spawn and towns looking nice
- Don't create eyesores or intentionally ugly builds
- Participate in server events and celebrations
- Support other players' shops and businesses
- Leave areas better than you found them
- Remember: your actions affect everyone's experience

## Additional Guidelines

**Reporting Issues**: If you see rule-breaking, don't engage - report it to staff privately. We're here to help maintain the cozy atmosphere.

**Consequences**: Rule violations may result in warnings, temporary mutes/bans, or permanent removal depending on severity. We believe in second chances for honest mistakes, but intentional harm to the community won't be tolerated.

**The Spirit of the Rules**: These rules exist to protect our community's special atmosphere. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Does this action make the server more enjoyable for everyone?" If the answer is no, please reconsider.

Remember: We're all here to relax, have fun, and be part of something special. Your kindness and consideration make this server the cozy haven it is!
