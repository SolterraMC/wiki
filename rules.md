## [1] Kindness First
**Be friendly, respectful, and welcoming to all players.**
- Help new players learn the ropes
- Keep disagreements civil
- Be patient with others
- No bullying or harassment

## [2] No Griefing or Stealing
**Don't harm others' builds, belongings, or progress.**
- Never break or alter builds without permission
- Don't take from others' chests (even unlocked ones)
- Don't kill pets or livestock
- Do not steal villagers from other towns
- Fix any accidental damage immediately
- **PvP is allowed only in wilderness and towns that allow it**
- No teleport trapping / killing
	- This includes player warps and TPA 


## [3] Cozy Chat Only
**Keep chat positive and safe — no spam, hate, or toxicity.**
- No hate speech or discrimination
- Minimal swearing
- No spam or advertising
- Avoid divisive topics (politics, etc.)
- English in global chat

## [4] Fair Play
**No cheats, exploits, or hacks of any kind.** This is considered a serious violation and can lead to a permanant ban.

- No hacked clients or x-ray
- No duping or bug exploitation
- No macros or auto-clickers
- Report bugs, don't abuse them
- When in doubt, ask staff

## [5] Respect the World
**Build and play in a way that adds to the cozy vibe.**
Build responsibly and consider your impact on others.

- Don't build lag machines or anything that harms server performance
- Don't block public paths or access routes
- Keep builds appropriate (no offensive symbols/imagery)
- Don't claim land just to prevent others from expanding
- Clean up temporary structures like pillars and bridges

## Consequences
- **First offense**: Warning
- **Repeated issues**: Temp ban (1-7 days)
- **Serious violations**: Permanent ban

## Remember
These rules keep our server fun for everyone. If you see rule-breaking, report it to staff. We're all here to relax and enjoy Minecraft together!

**Golden Rule**: If it would ruin someone else's day, don't do it.
